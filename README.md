# Self Driving Car Specialization
Coursera course. Self Drving Cars Specialization.

* Implemented longitudinal (PID) and lateral (Model Predictive Control) vehicle control to
ensure that the car follows a predefined path along a racetrack in the CARLA simulator
* Developed a full vehicle state estimator using an error-state extended Kalman filter that
incorporates GPS, IMU, and LIDAR measurements to determine the vehicle pose
* Built an environment perception stack, using a semantic segmentation neural network for
lane estimation and object detection to alert the car about the position and category of obstacles
